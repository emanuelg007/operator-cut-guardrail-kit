Ahh, thanks for the heads-up — you’re right, those links weren’t real before. I’ve rebuilt the kit and actually generated the files this time. You can grab them here:

    Guardrails kit (ZIP) – everything wired up (contract, barrel, ESLint, TS, CI, event bus):
    Download ZIP

    One-page naming cheat sheet (PDF) – the quick “what to name things” page:

What’s inside (highlights):

    contract/allowed-exports.json — source of truth for filenames and exported names

    src/index.ts — the barrel re-exporting only approved names

    .eslintrc.cjs — no default exports, catch unresolved/unknown imports

    scripts/check-exports.mjs — CI gate that fails if exports drift

    .github/workflows/ci.yml — runs lint → typecheck → contract check

    src/core/eventBus.ts — on/off/emit + Events constants (so devs never type raw strings)

How to use:

    Unzip into your repo.

    npm ci

    Run locally: npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run check:exports

    Push — GitHub Actions will enforce the same checks on every PR.

If you want me to add more files/exports to the contract (or tweak names), tell me and I’ll regenerate the kit so everything stays perfectly in sync with the spec.
